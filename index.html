      <p>Food delivery is an extremely convenient option if you want a meal. You don't need to cook, buy ingrdients or even go out. A research mentioned in an 
       article(1) indicated that the meal preparation time for usual meal preparers who purchased fast food was 27 minutes, versus 58 minutes for those who 
       did not purchase fast foodâ€”a time savings of 31 minutes, saving more than half of the time, not to mention the clean-up time for cooking at home. That is
       why food delivery is an extremely convenient option</p>
    <h3>Cost Efficiency:</h3>

      <p>Some may argue that the food delivery serveice is much expensive than cooking at home, but consider the transpotaion fee on the way to buy the ingrdients,
      the energy usage such as electricity or gas and the ingredients that can not be fully consumed, the cost different between deliveried food and home-made food 
      may not be as large as most people think due to these potential cost.</p>
    <h3>Health and Nutrition:</h3>

      option, such as Factor, Epicured, Daily Harvest and Sunbasket.</p>
